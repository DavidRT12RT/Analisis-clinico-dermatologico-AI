# Data Preprocessing and Classification

This project focuses on data preprocessing and classification using a Jupyter Notebook (`.ipynb`). It covers techniques such as missing value imputation, scaling, outlier detection, and training a classification model.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature scaling.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing data distributions and correlations.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implementing a `RandomForestClassifier` to classify diseases based on symptoms.

## Installation
To run this notebook, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook main.ipynb
   ```
2. Run each cell step by step to process the dataset and train the model.
3. Analyze the results and visualize performance metrics.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
